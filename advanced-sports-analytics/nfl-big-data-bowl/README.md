# 🏈 NFL Big Data Bowl — In-Stride Passing & Receiver Disruption
Tools: R, tidyverse, tracking data, Kaggle
Skills: Feature engineering, spatiotemporal analysis, custom metrics

This project was developed as part of the NFL Big Data Bowl competition. We create a custom “in-stride” metric that quantifies how quarterback ball placement affects receiver acceleration and route disruption around the catch point. Using frame-level player tracking data, the analysis connects receiver speed up and slow down to passing efficiency and play outcomes.
